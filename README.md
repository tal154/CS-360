**Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?**

The app I worked on is an inventory application to track items in a warehouse. The requirement/goals of this app are: 

A database with at least two tables, one to store the inventory items and one to store user logins and passwords

A screen for logging into the app. Note that this should also be used to create a login if the user has never logged in before.

A screen, with a grid, that displays all items in the inventory

A mechanism by which the user can add and remove items from inventory

A mechanism by which the user can increase or decrease the number of a specific item in the inventory

A mechanism by which the application will notify the user when the amount of any item in the inventory has been reduced to 0 (zero)

I was unable to finish the app due to personal issues and time contraints, but the foundation for app is there.

**What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?**

The screens needed were login, home/inventory, add/delete/update items from inventory, and permissions. My design kept the users in mind by giving a user friendly screen that is easy to understand at first glance. Each part that required users to enter information had hints, the buttons were labled, and each screen had limited number of functions to do to reduce the amount of possible confusion.

**How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?**

As I did not finish my app on time because of personal reasons, I will instead list what my strategy was going to be. My strategy for this project would have been to tackle each screen by frist creating every screen to know the framework of how each screen interacted together. Then, I would work on each screen's tasks that did not require another screen, such as transitioning to another screen. If I were to get every screen to work individually, then I would work on getting each screen to work in tandem. Testing would be done during the coding process of each screen, with each test being done after a new fix was made. This approach can be applied in future by keeping the development modular.

**How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?**

I did not get my code to work because of personal issues. The way I would have done this is by testing each screen indidually then testing them working in tandem. 

**Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?**

The database functions were where I had to innovate, although I did not finish. I needed to learn how to dynamically populate a list of items based on when they were entered. 

**In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?**

I did not get my code to work because of personal issues.
